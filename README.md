# Markdown Notemaker (Express)

Backend API for the Markdown Notemaker app. This app was built to be a simple tool
to convert Markdown files into HTML, and as a way to teach myself more of the
fundamentals of TypeScript and JavaScript.  

## Why tho?
As a VIM nerd/psycho, I try to do everything I can in VIM. As such, I often take
notes in the form of Markdown files. Every week
some friends and I play in a game of Dungeons and Dragons, and I take notes on
everything that happens - so, I decided to throw together this simple little site 
to dump and organize those notes in a place that other people can visit, 
to look back on all the shenanigans that we got up to.
